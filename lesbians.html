            <h><strong>WORLD BACKGROUND:</strong></h>
            <p>
                sci fi utopia! tall buildings, bright lights, lots of glass <br>
                world is unified under one government (Continents United) (CU) <br>
                CU is super corrupt, laws are passed according to the highest bidder (usually mega-corps) <br>
                <br>
                utopia for middle class and above <br>
                lower class people dont get any aid (health care, shelter, food, water all have to be paid for and are expensive) <br>

                most of the voluntary crimes are punishable by death (think like shoplifting, robbery, murder, battery, breaking and entering, drug dealing) (NOT running red lights or jay-walking, sometimes involuntary manslaughter) <br>
                this system results in less overall crime but now most crimes are murder <br>
                lower class people have no choice but to commit crime to survive <br>
                commiting crime like robbery will result in death sentence, so they cant afford to have any witnessess <br>
                people who commit crime are forced to murder their victim and anybody who saw it <br>
                <br>
                middle class and above people benefit from the death penalty system cuz they wouldnt need to be commiting those crimes anyway <br>
                <br>
                the year is like 2040 (not final) <br>
                history is mostly the same to ours <br>
                <br>
                CU formed after rising political tensions with countries invading other countries <br>

            <h><strong>COMPANY AND PRODUCT BACKGROUND:</strong></h>
            <p>
                i dont know the name of the company yet<br>
                for now ill call them x (like math)<br>
<br>
                WHAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS:<br>
<br>
                x is a mega-corp formed like 10 years before the game takes place<br>
                x's claim to fame was robots<br>
                in current year x does basically everything you can think of<br>
<br>
                x designed robots<br>
                these robots are just as smart as humans, and can do everything humans can do (plus a bit more)<br>
                robots do not have genitalia, and there were no official models nor accessories produced to change that<br>
                robots are basically just slaves<br>
<br>
                robot production goes in three steps<br>
                QA facility -> academy -> product<br>
<br>
                the robots are waken up in the QA facility, and go through the facility to have its quality assured<br>
                the robots then go basically like robot college where its taught how to do everything they need to do. robots often have whats described as "muscle memory" for most of the tasks they are taught, which speeds up the process<br>
                robots are then sent to distributors and sold.<br>
<br>
                WHATS TRUE:<br>
<br>
                ai doesnt exist anymore when this game takes place<br>
                starting in around 2022 there was an ai boom, but after a while there was so much ai content on the internet that AIs were being inbred, and eventually all AIs got worse, and no new AIs could be made to the same level<br>
                how do the robots work then? im sure you know<br>
<br>
                x takes human conciousness and puts it in the robot brains<br>
                i will go over how this works in a later section<br>
                ill refer to the conciousness as brain, but it isnt the actual mushy human brain, just the humans conciousness<br>
<br>
                brain is inserted into the robot<br>
                there are 9 floors to the QA facility<br>
                each floor has a roof the height of a warehouse (see image attached for reference)<br>
<br>
                robots wake up on the bottom floor<br>
                bottom floor is painted with nice colors to not overwhelm the brain, theres railings and safety stuff everywhere so the brain can get used to the body<br>
                <br>
                floors 2-9 are the quality assurance part of the facility<br>
                the robots are forced to repeat different tasks over and over again until they do it perfectly<br>
                each floor is themed after a different genre of task (havent decided what exactly)<br>
                this is torture<br>
                this is inhumane and evil and the robots are suffering<br>
<br>
                when a robot reaches the 9th floor, they enter an elevator<br>
                only one robot is allowed in the elevator at a time, but there are multiple elevators<br>
                each elevator has a device to erase the memories of the robot<br>
                the device is like an autonomous snake cable that plugs into the usb-c port on the robot (in its neck) (NOT FINAL)<br>
                the cable usually comes from behind so the robot doesnt even realize what happened<br>
<br>
                when the robot reaches the surface, their memories of the QA facility and their past life are erased fully (they cannot ever come back)<br>
                the robot academy is kind of for good publicity<br>
                academy is very humane, but takes way less time and resources for the robot to complete<br>
                from the outside it looks like perfectly normal<br>
                muscle memory in the academy is from the QA facility, but x explains it as the action being prepogrammed<br>
<br>
                in the prep stages of robot development, x ran demographic tests to see what kinds of people would make the best robots<br>
                x found that people aged 20-40 who were murdered are the best candidates for robots (this is where the lower class crime stuff comes in)<br>

            <h><strong>HOW THE CONCIOUSNESS STEALING DEVICE WORKS:</strong></h>
            <p>
                i imagine like a screwdriver that screws into the skull<br>
                <br>
                in this world there are two parts to a brain<br>
                theres the neurons which store the memories<br>
                then theres the data cells which contains all the data on the persons conciousness (aside from memory)<br>
                data cells are stored in the folds of the brain<br>
                traumatic events are usually memories that become a part of a data cell<br>
                <br>
                neurons are easy to scan and replicate<br>
                data cells are super complex and (as of now) impossible to scan and replicate<br>
                <br>
                the screwdriver device scans the neurons and sucks out all the data cells from the brain<br>
                to put the conciousness into the robot, you simply put all the data cells in the robot brain and take the neuron scans and put them on the brains storage device<br>
                to erase the memories, just wipe the drive<br>
